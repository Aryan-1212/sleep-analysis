      "content": "Yes, afternoon naps can sometimes interfere with nighttime sleep. When you nap, your body is producing melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. If you nap too close to bedtime, melatonin levels can drop, making it harder to fall asleep at night. Additionally, naps can disrupt REM sleep, a stage of deep sleep that is crucial for memory consolidation and emotional regulation. To ensure optimal sleep, it's recommended to avoid naps for more than 2 hours in the late afternoon or early evening."
