      "============================================================\n",
      "⚠️ **Priority Level: MODERATE** - Your sleep effectiveness is 73.9%\n",
      "Consider implementing 2-3 of these recommendations to improve your sleep:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ⚖️ **Work-Life Balance**: Establish clear boundaries between work/study and personal time. Avoid checking emails or work-related content before bed\n",
      "\n",
      "2. 🍷 **Substance Awareness**: Limit alcohol consumption, especially 3 hours before bedtime. Alcohol disrupts REM sleep and sleep quality\n",
      "\n",
      "3. 💪 **Regular Exercise Routine**: Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly. Morning workouts can help regulate circadian rhythms\n",
      "\n",
      "4. 🧘 **Mindfulness & Meditation**: Practice mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, or use guided sleep meditation apps\n",
      "\n",
      "5. 📅 **Consistent Schedule**: Maintain regular sleep-wake times even on weekends. Avoid 'social jet lag' from irregular weekend sleep patterns\n",
      "\n",
      "6. 🌡️ **Sleep Environment Optimization**: Invest in quality mattress and pillows. Keep bedroom temperature between 60-67°F for optimal sleep\n",
      "\n",
      "7. 🍽️ **Nutrition Timing**: Avoid large meals 3 hours before bedtime. If hungry, opt for light snacks with tryptophan (turkey, milk, bananas)\n",
      "\n",
      "8. 💼 **Financial Stress Management**: Address financial anxieties through budgeting, financial planning, or seeking counseling to reduce bedtime worry\n",
      "\n",
      "💡 **General Tips:**\n",
      "• Start with 1-2 recommendations and gradually incorporate more\n",
      "• Track your sleep improvements over 2-3 weeks\n",
      "• Consult healthcare providers for persistent sleep issues\n",
      "• Remember that sleep improvement takes time and consistency\n",
